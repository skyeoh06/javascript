Create a BMI Calculator that asks the user for his weight and height via two text input. There is also a radio button to ask if the users want to enter in imperial units (pounds for weight and feet for height), or in metric (kg for weight and metres for height).

Calculate the BMI depending on which option (imperial or metric) the unit has selected. You can use the alert function to show the BMI:

// pop up an alert box which has the content 'hi there' alert('hi there')
